						<b>Kaiya Latham | Kaiya Latham: Owner/Principal Instructor in Pole and Aerial Fitness</b><br>
						Kaiya Latham has been training in pole fitness for 5 years. Initially self taught she then began to take classes in 2009.
					</p>
					<p>
						Kaiya has been lucky enough to undertake training from:
					</p>
					<p>
						Karol Helms (US Pole Dance Federation East Coast Champion 2009 and USPDF Miss Sexy 2010)
						Jess Leanne Norris (Miss Pole Dance UK 2011)
						Bendy Kate (UKPPC Champion 2011 and star of Sky 1's GOT TO DANCE)
						Sarah Scott (Miss Pole Dance UK 2012)
						Marlo Fisken (US Xpert Pole Fitness master trainer)
						Kate Edwards (Spin City Aerial Hoop Instructor training and Pole Fabric)
						Elsie Smith - New England Centre for Circus Arts (NECCA) and formally of Cirque du Soleil - Aerial Silks and Trapeze Instructor training.
						Kaiya began dancing at the age of 5, beginning with Ballet and then moving onto Disco, Street Dance, Hip Hop and Freestyle dance. She holds International Dance Teacher Association certificates in Freestyle dance in both individual and pairs dance. Kaiya began her instructor training in Freestyle disco at the age of 17 through IDTA and then went onto teach children's classes in Freestyle disco and street dance within schools. Unfortunately she was then forced at the age of 20 to take a career break due to ill health.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once recovered a few years later she decided she wanted a new challenge. Which is where pole fitness came in! Kaiya purchased an X Pole and began to learn pole from videos on YouTube. Kaiya has a vast amount of experience in pole fitness and was lucky enough to be one of the first instructors in the UK to complete her Xpert Pole Fitness training in Sept 2012 under the instruction of Marlo Fisken, Jo Dandridge and Sarah Scott. She is also currently undertaking Aerial Hoop instructor training from Kate Johnstone (Spin City). Shortly after this Kaiya began to undertake aerial arts, beginning with Aerial Hoop (Lyra) in 2011 and soon afterwards Aerial Silks and Trapeze. In January 2014 Kaiya undertook instructor training in Aerial Silk and Trapeze from Elsie Smith of NECCA and formally of Cirque du Soleil.
					</p>
					<p>
						Kaiya's journey from her first pole lesson to opening KL Pole Studio has been somewhat extraordinary and inspiring as she has Asperger Syndrome (a type of Autism) which affects communication and social skills. However since beginning her pole training and meeting lots of amazing new people within the pole world her confidence has progressed in ways that could never have been imagined. Kaiya decided to set up KL Pole Studio as she wanted to share and help other people to experience just how this beautiful art form can not only help you achieve your fitness goals, but can change peoples lives!

						<b>Julia Cowell | Pole Fitness Instructor</b><br>
						It is safe to say that since Julia attended her first pole dancing class seven years ago she has been in love with the art of pole dancing ever since! She has always been interested in active sports, starting out at gymnastics as a small child, she went on to try a vast diversity of activities including martial arts, figure skating and hardcore gym work up until she became addicted to pole, and as an experienced instructor she incorporates all these elements into her classes. Now looking to break into the professional competition circuit in the UK, she has gone from strength to strength and has been taught by some of the industries greats including Jenyne Butterfly and Suzie Q, as well as performing with Pantera and in venues across the world. Now teaching for KL Pole Studio, you can be sure that you are in capable and experienced hands from your first swing all the way through you the most advanced of tricks.
