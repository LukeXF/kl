			The aerial hoop (also known as the lyra) is a circular steel apparatus (resembling a hula hoop) suspended from the ceiling, on which circus artists perform aerial acrobatics. It can be used static, spinning, or swinging. Our aerial hoop classes are for all abilities and are suitable for total beginners! If you are looking for your first aerial experience we highly recommend starting with aerial hoop or trapeze!

		<div class="col-md-12">
			<h1 class="small">Aerial Silks</h1>
			Aerial silks is a type of performance in which one or more artists perform aerial acrobatics while hanging from a special fabric. They use the fabric to wrap, suspend, fall, swing, and spiral their bodies into and out of various positions. Our studio has 4-5 metre high ceilings meaning our silks can be used to their full potential and for activities such as drops and rolls! Our classes are suitable for beginners to intermediate level and we will accept total beginners; however we do recommend that you undertake either pole or another aerial discipline in order to build up the strength required for silks. Aerial silks tuition is available in our Mixed Aerial Classes or in our regular workshops that are held once or twice a month!

					<b>Kaiya Latham | Owner/Principal Instructor in Pole and Aerial</b><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Xpert Pole Fitness Instructor<br>
					PDC 3 Star Approved Instructor<br>
					NECCA Qualified Aerial Instructor <br>
					Spin City Qualified Aerial Hoop Instructor<br>
					Spin City Anatomy &amp; Physiology <br>
					First Aid Qualified<br>
					Enhanced DBS Checked<br>
					<br>
					Kaiya Latham has been training in pole fitness for 6 years and aerial arts for 4 years. Initially starting in 2008 self taught, she then began to take classes in early 2009 in pole and then began aerial training in 2011.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kaiya has been lucky enough to undertake training from many high profile people within the pole and aerial industry including; Karol Helms (US Pole Dance Federation East Coast Champion 2009), Jess Leanne Norris (Miss Pole Dance UK 2011), Bendy Kate (UKPPC Champion 2011, star of Sky 1's GOT TO DANCE and WORLD POLE SPORT CHAMPION 2014), Sarah Scott (Miss Pole Dance UK 2012), Marlo Fisken (US Xpert Pole Fitness master trainer), Kate Edwards (Spin City Aerial Hoop Instructor training and Pole Fabric) and Elsie Smith &amp; Serenity Forchion (New England Centre for Circus Arts (NECCA) and formally of Cirque du Soleil)
				</p>
				<p>
					Kaiya has a vast amount of experience in pole fitness and aerial and was lucky enough to be one of the first instructors in the UK to complete her Xpert Pole Fitness training in Sept 2012 under the instruction of Marlo Fisken, Jo Dandridge and Sarah Scott. Shortly after this Kaiya began to undertake aerial arts, beginning with Aerial Hoop (Lyra) in 2011 and soon afterwards Aerial Silks and Trapeze. In January 2014 Kaiya undertook instructor training in Aerial Silk and Trapeze from Elsie Smith and Serenity Forchion of NECCA and formally of Cirque du Soleil and is currently one of just a handful of instructors in the UK to hold this qualification. Kaiya has also worked with Aim to Fly - a charity that aims to provide opportunities for people with disabilities to learn aerial skills.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kaiya's journey from her first pole lesson and aerial training to opening KL Pole &amp; Aerial Studio has been somewhat extraordinary and inspiring as she has Asperger Syndrome (a type of Autism) which affects communication, social skills and coordination. However since beginning her pole and aerial training and meeting lots of amazing new people within the community her confidence has progressed in ways that could never have been imagined. Kaiya decided to set up KL Pole &amp; Aerial Studio as she wanted to share and help other people to experience just how this beautiful art form can not only help you achieve your fitness goals, but can change people's lives! She is also very passionate about working with both children and adults with disabilities in the hope that aerial arts will have a positive impact on their physical and emotional health and help them in the same way it has helped her.
