		<h1 class="small" id="tweleve">Why are pole and aerial classes more expensive than a normal exercise class or gym membership?</h1>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>	
					This is a question we get asked frequently! The main reason for this is because when you attend a pole or aerial class you are not just paying to get fit - you are paying to learn a SKILL! Due to the nature of the activities we teach we also have to have a higher level of insurance, expensive equipment which needs to be maintained regularly and our instructors have undergone more specialised training than a normal fitness instructor which they are constantly having to update to comply with our insurance.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>
					It is with this in mind that our classes are priced as they are. You will find that our prices meet the average cost of pole and aerial tuition across the UK and meet the requirements of the PDC "fair pricing" rules.
